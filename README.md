INSTALATION

Install Tampermonkey: First, you need to install the Tampermonkey extension for your browser. This extension is available for various browsers. You can typically find it in your browser's extension store or marketplace. Here are some quick links:

Tampermonkey for Chrome
Tampermonkey for Firefox
Tampermonkey for Edge
Tampermonkey for Opera
Open Tampermonkey Dashboard: Click on the Tampermonkey extension icon in your browser's toolbar and select "Dashboard."

Create a New Script: Within the Tampermonkey Dashboard, navigate to the "Utilities" tab and click on "Create a new script."

Install the Script: You need to paste the provided userscript into the new script window that Tampermonkey opens. After pasting the script, you can press "File" then "Save" or press Ctrl + S to save the script.

Enable the Script: Make sure the script is enabled by checking that the toggle switch next to the script's name in the Tampermonkey Dashboard is in the "on" position.

Disable Your Adblocker for YouTube: You should whitelist YouTube in any other ad-blocking extensions or software you have. Since the script is designed to remove ads from YouTube, it will handle the ad removal process instead.

How to Use the Undetected Adblock Feature:

Install the script as per the instructions above.
Whitelist YouTube in any other ad-blocking extensions or software you have.
The script should now work to remove ads from YouTube, potentially allowing you to watch videos without interruption even if you've faced restrictions due to using an adblocker in the past.
Remember to check the script periodically, as YouTube's code updates may require updates to the userscript for continued functionality.
